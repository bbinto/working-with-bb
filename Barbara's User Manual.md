## Barbara’s general user manual

**What did you want to be when you grew up?**
- A medical doctor, the moment I fainted getting my blood taken, I decided to focus on computers, they don’t bleed!

**What are your quirks? What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?**
- I’ve heard several times in my life that I look too serious and upset. My normal facial expression can seem rude or not happy. That is however the COMPLETE opposite. So please don’t ever think Im upset when I look upset
- While I consider myself happy to be around people and socialize, I need equal time to myself, so if I hide somewhere, it’s just that I need to recharge my batteries.
- I sometimes take a bit longer to make decisions than others.

**What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?**
- Honesty, constructive feedback, I never feel offended if somebody provides me with feedback about my work. I actually seek this, and I find it’s quite challenging at times to read people’s minds - well, it never works!
- Understanding and being understood (listen to understand) - It’s so important for me to show and try to put myself in other people's shoes, and really really hope the other person tries to do the same.
- Humor: I love to laugh with my co-workers and team. Humor is such a big part of life for me, and if I feel we all don't always have to take ourselves too serious, it helps to let loose and be actually more creative, more risky and adventurous
- Accoutnability :
- Partnership / Empathy:

**What’s the best way to communicate with you?**
- I'm fine with pretty much all written communication, ideally indicating when I need to reply / if it’s urgent so I can better estimate my schedule (I do like to structure my day into pre-scheduled meetings). I like to take time to think and reply especially if it’s something I need to research or think about first. Pushing for a quick answer might make me uncomfortable.
- Setting up an impromptu meeting, if not very important, might sometimes not be the best way to get my full attention since it might interrupt my schedule for the day or what I wanted to get done

**What is your work schedule? (WFH, core hours, etc)**

- I’m a ***very*** early bird and tend to work (i.e. check/reply Slack and emails) between 6am ET - 9am ET, then ideally, if no meetings are scheduled, I like to work-out every second day, and jump on my spin bike between 9-11am ET, or play tennis from 8am-9am ET once a week.

**Any other miscellaneous thoughts on team dynamics or things you care about?**

- I really want to feel myself at work, have great people around me and by being truly yourself, I will be very happy

### What I will give you
As your manager, I want you to know that I will always try my best to provide you with psychological safety, transparency, constructive and honest feedback, context and trust. One of my most important goals as a manager is to help you excel in your career, highlight your best skills, and will always look for opportunities where I can help support you to grow. 

I want to help and do anything I can to make sure you feel comfortable and supported by me throughout our journey together, so you can perform at your best and be your most authentic self. And please remember, your (mental/physical) health always goes first! I’ll try my best to not disturb you via email/Slack message outside of working hours, if I ever do so though, I do not expect you to reply right away.

I consider my management and leadership style as a “[Connector](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/insights/publications/connector-manager)”.

Like anybody else, well, any normal human being, I have days, times and moments where I make mistakes and I will try my best to share and be transparent about it. It’s equally ok **and** important that you feel comfortable making mistakes as well, so that we can learn and improve from them.

Emotional Intelligence AND vulernability belong under the great leadership definition; With that comes times where I will share and feel I don't have all the answers and will admit.

### What I will ask of you
What I would like to ask from you is that you (aspire to) show up with these 3 important traits (and I’ll do the same): 
* **Self-awareness**: Conscious knowledge of one's own character, feelings, motives, and desires
* **Reliability**: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t over promise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities (Brene Brown)
* **Accountability**: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends (Brene Brown).
