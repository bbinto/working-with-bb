## Barbara’s general user manual**

**What did you want to be when you grew up?**
A medical doctor, the moment I fainted getting my blood taken, I decided to focus on computers, they don’t bleed!

**What are your quirks? What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?**
- I’ve heard several times in my life that I look too serious and upset. My normal facial expression can seem rude or not happy. That is however the COMPLETE opposite. So please don’t ever think Im upset when I look upset
- While I consider myself happy to be around people and socialize, I need equal time to myself, so if I hide somewhere, it’s just that I need to recharge my batteries.
- I sometimes take a bit longer to make decisions than others.

**What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?**
- Honesty, constructive feedback, I never feel offended if somebody provides me with feedback about my work. I actually seek this, and I find it’s quite challenging at times to read people’s minds - well, it never works!
- Understanding and being understood (listen to understand) - It’s so important for me to show and try to put myself in other people's shoes, and really really hope the other person tries to do the same.
- Humor: I love to laugh with my co-workers and team. Humor is such a big part of life for me, and if I feel we all don't always have to take ourselves too serious, it helps to let loose and be actually more creative, more risky and adventurous
- Accoutnability :
- Partnership / Empathy:

**What’s the best way to communicate with you?**
- I'm fine with pretty much all written communication, ideally indicating when I need to reply / if it’s urgent so I can better estimate my schedule (I do like to structure my day into pre-scheduled meetings). I like to take time to think and reply especially if it’s something I need to research or think about first. Pushing for a quick answer might make me uncomfortable.
- Setting up an impromptu meeting, if not very important, might sometimes not be the best way to get my full attention since it might interrupt my schedule for the day or what I wanted to get done

**What is your work schedule? (WFH, core hours, etc)**

- I’m a ***very*** early bird and tend to work (i.e. check/reply Slack and emails) between 6am ET - 9am ET, then ideally, if no meetings are scheduled, I like to work-out every second day, and jump on my spin bike between 9-11am ET, or play tennis from 8am-9am ET once a week.

**Any other miscellaneous thoughts on team dynamics or things you care about?**

- I really want to feel myself at work, have great people around me and by being truly yourself, I will be very happy
