# Barbara's Operating System (BOS) v1.0

The following list and notes aim to share with the reader how/why/when I operate as a product leader. It's like my own Operating System. It helps you understand what I consider good work, being efficient, providing safety and continous and honest feedback.

**Foundation: Psychological Safety (PS)***: 
Basis for all my actions, drivers and asks is ["Psychological Safety"](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1359145757266296838?s=20). Mostly known as one of the key outcomes during the [Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/) research done by Google, PS is the feeling is safe to feel uncomfortable. 

On top of above foundation, I like to breakdown my leadership into the following 3 pillars that are either equally or not propertional, based on the business needs, distributed:

1. **Process**: Process is important, pending the size and specific growth stage the company is in, process and operations need to be tigher than for e.g. smaller companies.
2. **People**: How I define people management, value indivualism, thrive for inclusion and diversity and psychological saftey
3. **Product**: My product management principles, the way I think, manage and have learned what is important about good product manegement. Some frameworks I like to follow or have adopted and/or changed according to my needs.  

## 1. Process (including Norms & Principles)
In order to build on top of psychological safety, team members must feel comfortable sharing any uncomfortable events and news without being punished not following the group norms. In order to identify these events, teams need to understand and align on expectations.
Expecations are the basis to form and follow norms and principles. If we are all clear on expectations, we know what to commit to, how to build trust, and how/when to escalate concerns. The team, collectively will come up with norms and principles that each commits to adhere to. I speciacially will remind my team constantly on what I expect so the individual understands what good performance looks like.

### Communication & Documentation
There is never too much communication nor oversharing, period! It's the way when and how it's written; ideally provide a tl;dr and a thread/link to more context if needed.

As for timely, I rather have you bring up issues, concerns, information ealier than later and worst, not at all, therefore, please consider the following; when in doubt, please communicate. FYI; "Over"-communication is a word you will hear from me a lot. 

Especially for async comms via channels like Slack/Teams, I want you to follow the below considerations
- Remember, attention is a commodity, choose wisely if/when to tag a team or person
- Always be polite and assume positive intend; we all come with cultural differences, ways of communicating AND receiving feedback; e.g research has shown that politness async, in writing is even more important than verbal politeness.
- Documentation in a world of remote work, async communication and different timezones, is mandatory as information and project statuses have to be available 24/7. The best you can do for yourself and team is to have your work, status and thoughts written down. Please make sure that you document **everything** that could be ask of off your feature, project, team or plans, and encourage your counterparts to do the same.

### Share Impact
Especially for remote workforces, continous sharing of impact needs to happen, consistently and constantly. I have seen the following plenty of times; people assume what they did is either not a big deal, or they don't want to bother anybody with it, and therefore don't share their work or impact. Most of the time, this impact is of interest to at least one person/team, writing it into a channel, present it at an all-hands or weekly meeting is crucial to not only keep the conversations going but also share what you have worked on. 

As part of your individual and team performance, I will ask you to share your most impactful projects within each performance cycle, the more data related to OKRs and impact, the better.

### For You: Context is King
Phrased as "lead with context and not control" by Reed Hastings in [No rules rules](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention), providing context to your team is key in building trust and motivating team members. This is especially important when you have not only ICs but also managers and several levels of managers below you.

### You + Executives: Be brief and clear
I've noticed over the years that it's difficult at times for more junior people and ICs to know how and what to share and what not to share with executives. Of course, that depends not only on the person but also the executive. 
The biggest rule of thumb is; you can share all the problems with them/me, but please be prepared to follow up with options/solutions immediately without being asked specifcially. That shows you are concious of the executives time and know how to make sure they leave the conversation hopeful and trustful in you.

Be super aware of how to not overload your exectuive with information. They [hear](https://blog.staysaasy.com/p/dont-bring-me-problems-bring-me-solutions?utm_source=pocket_reader), see, respond to many small and big fires, help them understand quickly what is at stakes: Apply the [billboard](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7162791135776632832/) test, what can you say in the fewest amount of words to get people to stay attentive?

### Meetings
#### Welcome / First Time Meeting

The goal of our first 1-1 is to get to know you, give you space and time to ask questions and most importantly leave you energized and motivated to start working together.

I will share a set of question prior to get to know you, your ambitions, how to receive feedback et. 
See link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=1897604316).

#### User Manuals & About Me
In addition, I will ask you to write up your own personal user manual and share it with me/accessible to all within the company.

Both documents are great ways to describe yourself, let others know about your operating model and your background and history. Make sure to keep them available to your team so they can always go back and review.

* About me [deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19ScYsmCkc5wcxO1mNtk71FCGL9bNRIjWdhLiIzgr4kY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Barbara's User [manual](https://github.com/bbinto/working-with-bb/blob/main/Barbara's%20User%20Manual.md)
* User Manual [template](https://github.com/bbinto/working-with-bb/blob/main/Templae%20%5BName%5D%20-%20User%20Manual.md)


#### 1:1 Meetings
My goal is to almost never skip 1-1s, if I do, I normally explain and provide context and at least try to re-schedule. The 1-1 is for you, about you! Please use the prepared questions and or notes to list out any topics you want to discuss. 

I tend to schedule a personal OKR meeting each month to discuss career goals, so we both keep chatting about growth, and opportunities and don't get distracted by daily topics.

In addition, a [question/project tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=909536391) is useful to keep both of us aligned on the work you are doing, keep it updated and we only have to chat about it if needed/required. 

#### Team Meetings
Equally important to 1-1 meetings are team meetings. They can be scheduled weekly, bi-weekly or monthly pending on the size of my direct reports, the growth of the company and the maturity. The goal of these meetings is to form and build a high performanent team that can trust and support each other. This includes getting to know each other beyond work, team building activities, alignment on how to be successful, sharing of failures and wins so everyone can help and learn. 

#### "No device" Meetings
In general, I trust and believe people have good attention to stay connected to the topic of the meeting they are in. I also know though that things can distract us = slack and phones. I will ask you, at times, for specific meetings to not look at your other devices. It's for the broader good and it's respectful to give your co-workers or manager the attention and focus they deserve. Don't argue with me on that, if you are/get distracted, drop or don't join the meeting. 

## 2. People

### What I will give you
As your manager, I want you to know that I will always try my best to provide you with psychological safety, transparency, constructive and honest feedback, context and trust. One of my most important goals as a manager is to help you excel in your career, highlight your best skills, and will always look for opportunities where I can help support you to grow. 

I want to help and do anything I can to make sure you feel comfortable and supported by me throughout our journey together, so you can perform at your best and be your most authentic self. And please remember, your (mental/physical) health always goes first! I’ll try my best to not disturb you via email/Slack message outside of working hours, if I ever do so though, I do not expect you to reply right away.

I consider my management and leadership style closes to a “[Connector](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/insights/publications/connector-manager)”.

Like anybody else, well, any normal human being, I have days, times and moments where I make mistakes and I will try my best to share and be transparent about it. It’s equally ok **and** important that you feel comfortable making mistakes as well, so that we can learn and improve from them.

**Emotional Intelligence AND vulernability** belong under my leadership definition; With that come times where I will share and feel I don't have all the answers and will admit.

### What I will ask of you
What I would like to ask from you is that you (aspire to) show up with these 3 important traits (and I’ll do the same): 
* **Self-awareness**: Have a conscious knowledge of one's own character, feelings, motives, and desires.
* **Reliability**: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t over promise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities (Brene Brown)
* **Accountability**: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends (Brene Brown).

### Others: Relationship with Engineering & Design (, and others)
Culture is defined as what happens when you are not in the room. The most important and unfortunately sometimes not recgonized and valued enough is your relationship with engineering. Design and product, in my experience work easier together. 

I ask you to please get to know, build, foster your relationship with your engineering and design counter part. This goes beyond "I told her about x", "we talked about y" - Building trust and the correct culture needs time and requires to truly get to know your team. Take the time, setup 1-1s, share feedback early.

You can use [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=2005876786) template to start writing and assigning responsibilities. 

### Performance
I prefer to use leveling [documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3dh94ityugEbRZIbJLJweH8cToplu7w/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true), approved by management, and try to assess your [skills](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W6hFhwNJhLsJPesPEkgIrHQDcD3XIjyD/edit#gid=134571841) in the first 1-2 months working together, this will all be transparently shared and discussed with you. I will share the spreadsheet with you in one of our 1-1s - this will be based on the [PMFlyWheel](https://www.strongproductpeople.com/pmwheel)

I have a notepad I use to jot down opportunities, wins, impact etc, screenshots, emails etc. during each performance cycle. I encourage you to do the same for yourself so you can share with me if I missed anything.

Please remember; I'm here to help you, and lead you to the role/goals you have, let's work together, openly to get you there. My goal is to make my feedback always be fair, and empathic. I like to use the [SBI](https://fellow.app/blog/feedback/sbi-feedback-model/) framework to provide and support my evaluation of your performance.
In addition, please also understand and remember that I'm hired by the business to make the company successful by building and fostering the right people for the job. My job is to bring out the best of you, for youself AND the business.

## 3. Product

I love working in the SaaS / B2B product space. To me, it's the best value exchange you can ask for between a company and customers; People seek solutions that will help them get a task done better and/or more cheaply, and with companies looking for compount strategies, customers know now that they can look and ask for products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform. They will want to pay for this while providing valuable and continous feedback.

### Strategy - my version

![Strategy version](https://github.com/bbinto/working-with-bb/blob/main/img/strategy-breakdown.png)

### Execution and Strategy
While I know and believe a good strategy is an important path to keep everyone focused and in one common direction, what I have learned is that people love to advice how/what to do so solve a problem but not all can and want to actually DO what they say, meaning the willingness and motiviation to execute is at times way more important. In case you want a former US president to further eloaborate on this, have a quick look at this [video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/barbarabermes_when-former-us-president-barack-obama-was-activity-7079049160699613186-hFOQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) from Obama.
 
"Just learn how to get stuff done." 

I also highly recommend and refer a lot to Frank Slootman's ["Amp it up"](https://www.amazon.ca/Amp-Unlocking-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Intensity/dp/1119836115) book that outlines similar concepts than above.
Strategy is highly correalted and measured by quarterly and yearly OKRs for me. I like to use outcome-driven roadmaps that level up to OKRS and vision of the company, see [this](https://bbinto.medium.com/why-is-this-still-so-hard-data-literacy-in-modern-product-design-teams-36501cedab84) post for more details and templates.

### Documents, Frameworks and Planning

Let's be clear, every company wants/can/ will do specific artifacts differently. There is no right way, nor one size fits all, therefore, here some templates/guidelines that helped me before. 

It's immensly important to understand the phases of a project. Having the right stakeholders with the right and enough amount of information in every stage is crucial in keeping the project moving in the right direction with the least amount of delays or duplication of interruptions. 

**Kick-off**
* Project Alignment Document (PAD), template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qfP3-mXilJ_TmUf3B654DdrNfgnZh2P1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true), can be used for product reviews, concise to avoid going down too deep. 
* PAD can be used, extended to get the team excited, aligned and motivated. You can use a deck as a kick-off document.

**Development**

**Go-To-Market & Post GTM**
This is extremely important to me and isn't been done often, make sure to review the launched product/feature and iterate/learn from it.
* Feature Review meeting/deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11FtrCSee-qabQoSqItSitpl-pagK37on/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true)
* Go-to-market (GTM) and GTM process: It's always good to define different tiers of features and releases to help communicate impact/training/sales on the specific feature. I make sure my team works closely with your CX and marketing leader. Name of the game is here is consistency and timely accuracy. Knowing how and when to communicate internally first is key for a successful customer-facing launch. 
* Ongoing: Align your persona and segments with your x-teams especially marketing. I have seen this before, product, marketing and sales all speak of different personas or segments and how they are defined. This is crucial for talking the same language and therefore addressing the problems/solution for the right/correct segment.

**On-going/Quarterly**

The following artifacts, frameworks and operations all are preferred by me when running product teams.
(Please note some of the below documents can't be shared in templates form due to business insights and data)

* OKRs, quarterly/rolled up to company OKRs, reviewed monthly, trackable daily (via dashboards). Aligned with the OKRs, teams work best when they have proper OKR dashboards available to them and their leaders. I will ask you/data team to provide them for each quarter, they will be input for our monthly chats.
* Outcome driven roadmap, see my post [here](https://bbinto.medium.com/the-behavioural-and-relational-characteristics-of-successful-product-teams-94c4255bdb8) for some Miro inspiration and template
* Structured operating model aligned to quartlery planning, inspired by ["The Cadence"](https://medium.com/craft-ventures/the-cadence-how-to-operate-a-saas-startup-436aa8099e8)
* Ideas & Prioritization Exercises; it's very important to align with everyone on your team, including myself and upper management how input is being treated. There are many inputs we can use to build our quarter, roadmap, stratey and next few years for your team. General Inputs: Current OKRs, company strategy, NPS, CSAT, CX tickets, feature requests, current feature adoption dashboards, monthly product performance [read-outs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b4ITyBz35ij_iDnlUQBBdqCw1AkMWMeU/view?usp=sharing). Below some examples
    * [$40 Prio exercise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=1559938549)
    * Don't forget about bugs, tech debt etc; please make sure to allocated time, and if needed, use the sheet to prioritize ruthlesly [RICE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_PnuXIKeUv2FDk2l-GaBv07d9bmG6FV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true) for bugs
    * Throuhout the quarter/year, I ask you to be pro-active and show motivation for your product area, I invite you to constantly ask yourself; what needs to be changed, can be done better? How can we do things better?
