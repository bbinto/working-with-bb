# Barbara's Operating System (BOS) v1.0

The following list and notes aim to share with the reader how/why/when I operate as a product leader. It's like my own Operating System. It helps (you) understand what I consider good work, being efficient, providing safety and continuous and honest feedback.

**My Foundation & Motivation: Psychological Safety (PS)**: 
The basis for all my actions, drivers and asks is ["Psychological Safety"](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1359145757266296838?s=20). Mostly known as one of the key outcomes during the [Aristotle](https://psychsafety.co.uk/googles-project-aristotle/) research done by Google of what is needed to build performant teams, Psychological Safety means to be safe to feel uncomfortable. 

On top of the above foundation, I like to break my leadership into the following 3 pillars that are either equally or not proportional distributed depending on the company's current business needs:

1. **Process**: List of Processes, norms and important rules, pending the size and specific growth stage the company is in, e.g. process and operations need to be tighter than for e.g. smaller companies.
2. **People**: How I define people management, value individualism, thrive for inclusion and diversity and psychological safety.
3. **Product**: My product management principles, the way I think, manage and have learned what is key about good product management, including some frameworks I like to follow or have adopted and/or changed according to my needs.  

## 1. Process (including Norms & Principles)
To build on top of psychological safety, team members must feel comfortable sharing any uncomfortable events and news without being punished for not following the group norms. To identify these events, teams need to understand and align on expectations.
(My, our) Expectations are the basis to form and follow norms and principles. If we are all clear on expectations, we know what to commit to, how to build trust, and how/when to escalate concerns. The team, collectively will come up with norms and principles that each individual commits to adhere to. I specifically will remind my team constantly about what I expect so the individual understands what (good) performance looks like.

### Communication & Documentation
There is never too much communication or oversharing, period! It's **the way** when and how it's written; ideally, provide a tl;dr and a thread/link to more context if needed.

As for timely, I rather have you bring up issues, concerns, and information earlier than later and worse, not at all, therefore, please consider the following; when in doubt, please communicate. FYI; "Over"-communication is a word you will hear from me a lot. 

Especially for async comms via channels like Slack/Teams, I want you to follow the below considerations
- Remember, attention is a commodity, choose wisely if/when to tag a team or person
- Always be polite and assume positive intent; we all come with cultural differences, and ways of communicating AND receiving feedback; e.g research has shown that politeness async, in writing is even more paramount than verbal politeness. Don't worry, I will remind you of that :) 
- Documentation in a world of remote work, with async communication and different timezones, is mandatory as information and project statuses have to be available 24/7. The best you can do for yourself and your team is to have your work, status and thoughts written down. Please make sure that you document **everything** that could be asked of your feature, project, team or plans, and encourage your counterparts (tech lead, product designer) to do the same.

### Share Impact
Equally crucial is the sharing of impact, consistently and constantly. I have seen the following plenty of times; people assume what they did/accomplished is either not a big deal, too much work to summarize, or they don't want to bother anybody with it, and therefore don't share their work or impact. Most of the time, the work is of interest to at least one person/team, writing it into a channel, or presenting it at an all-hands or weekly meeting is crucial to not only keep the conversations going but also share what you have worked on. 

As part of your individual and team performance, I will ask you to share your most impactful projects within each performance cycle, the more data related to OKRs and impact, the better.

### For You: Context is King
Phrased as "lead with context and not control" by Reed Hastings in [No rules rule](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention), providing context as a leader to my team is key in building trust and motivating team members. This is key when I manage not only ICs but also managers and several levels of managers below you.

### You + Executives: Be brief and clear
I've noticed over the years that it's difficult at times for more junior people and ICs to know how and what to share and what not to share with executives. The biggest rule of thumb is; that you can share all the problems with them/me, but please be prepared to follow up with options/solutions immediately without being asked specifically. That shows you are conscious of the executives' time and know how to make sure they leave the conversation hopeful and trustful in you. When in doubt, come to me first and we can work on talking points together.

Be super aware of how to not overload your executive with information. They [hear](https://blog.staysaasy.com/p/dont-bring-me-problems-bring-me-solutions?utm_source=pocket_reader), see, respond to many small and big fires, help them understand quickly what is at stake: Apply the [billboard](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7162791135776632832/) test, what can you say in the fewest amount of words to get people to stay attentive?

### Meetings
#### Welcome / First Time Meeting

The goal of our first 1-1 is to get to know you, give you space and time to ask questions and most importantly leave you energized and motivated to start working together. This is only shared between you and me.

I will share a set of questions prior to getting to know you, your ambitions, how to receive feedback etc. 
See template/link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=1897604316) for a starting point.

#### User Manuals & About Me
In addition, I will ask you to write up your user manual and share it with me, ideally accessible to all within the company. I believe it can and will be beneficial for others as well.

Both documents are great ways to describe yourself, and let others know about your operating model and your background and history. 

* About me [deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19ScYsmCkc5wcxO1mNtk71FCGL9bNRIjWdhLiIzgr4kY/edit?usp=drive_link) (will be made available to my team, otherwise protected)
* Barbara's User [manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7IOSealLuPcTZYxdFSfbHLs0CBHH-P8s3ddftgq5M0/edit?usp=drive_link) (will be made available to my team, otherwise protected)
* User Manual [template](https://github.com/bbinto/working-with-bb/blob/main/templates/Templae%20%5BName%5D%20-%20User%20Manual.md)


#### 1:1 Meetings
My goal is to rarely skip 1-1s, if I do, I normally explain and provide context and at least try to re-schedule. The 1-1 is for you, about you! Please use the prepared questions and or notes to list any topics you want to discuss. 

I tend to schedule a personal OKR/growth meeting each month to discuss career goals, so we both keep chatting about growth, and opportunities and don't get distracted by daily topics.

In addition, a [status/project tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=909536391) is useful to keep both of us aligned on the work you are doing, keep it updated and we only have to chat about it if needed/required. 

#### Team Meetings
Equally important to 1-1 meetings are my team meetings. They can be scheduled weekly, bi-weekly or monthly depending on the size of my direct reports, the growth of the company and the maturity. The goal of these meetings is to form and build a high performant team that can trust and support each other. This includes getting to know each other beyond work, team building activities, alignment on how to be successful, and sharing of failures and wins so everyone can help and learn. 

#### "No device" Meetings & Respect
In general, I trust and believe people pay good attention to stay connected to the topic of the meeting they are in. I also know though that things can distract us = Slack and phones. I will ask you, at times, for specific meetings to not look at your other devices. It's for the broader good and it's respectful to give your co-workers or manager the attention and focus they deserve. Don't argue with me on that, if you are/get distracted, drop or don't join the meeting.

Meetings I sit in or run will always focus on structure, empathy, respect, and outcomes. My goal is to support, remind and interrupt if needed if any of those are not followed. I like the respect quote below from the Crucial Conversations book:

“Respect is like air. As long as it's present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it's all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.”
― Ron McMillan, Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High

## 2. People

### What I will give you
As your manager, I want you to know that I will always try my best to provide you with psychological safety, transparency, constructive and honest feedback, context and trust. One of my most essential goals as a manager is to help you excel in your career, and highlight/advance your best skills, and will always look for opportunities where I can help support you to grow. 

I want to help and do anything I can to make sure you feel comfortable and supported by me throughout our journey together, so you can perform at your best and be your most authentic self. And please remember, your (mental/physical) health always goes first! I’ll try my best to not disturb you via email/Slack message outside of working hours, if I ever do so though, I do not expect you to reply right away unless specified as urgent.

I consider my management and leadership style close to a “[Connector](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/insights/publications/connector-manager)”.

Like anybody else, well, any normal human being, I have days, times and moments where I make mistakes and I will try my best to share and be transparent about it. It’s equally ok **and** fundamental that you feel comfortable making mistakes as well, so that we can learn and improve from them.

**Emotional Intelligence AND vulnerability** belong under my leadership definition; with that will come times where I will share and feel I don't have all the answers and will admit.

### What I will ask of you
What I would like to ask from you is that you (aspire to) show up with these 3 central traits (and I’ll do the same): 
* **Self-awareness**: Have a conscious knowledge of one's character, feelings, motives, and desires.
* **Reliability**: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t over-promise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities (Brene Brown)
* **Accountability**: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends (Brene Brown).

### Others: Relationship with Engineering & Design
Culture is defined as what happens when you are not in the room. The most necessary and unfortunately sometimes not recognized and valued enough is your relationship with engineering. Design and product, in my experience, work easier together. 

I ask you to please get to know, build, and foster your relationship with your engineering and design counterpart. This goes beyond "I told her about x", "we talked about y" - Building trust and the correct culture needs time and requires truly get to know your team. Take the time, set up 1-1s, and share feedback early.

You can use [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=2005876786) template to start writing and assigning responsibilities. 

### Performance
To avoid any bias and support equality, I mandate to use career ladders/leveling [documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3dh94ityugEbRZIbJLJweH8cToplu7w/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true), approved by company's leaders & HR (important), and try to assess your [skills](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W6hFhwNJhLsJPesPEkgIrHQDcD3XIjyD/edit#gid=134571841) in the first 1-2 months working together, this will all be transparently shared and discussed with you. I will share the spreadsheet with you in one of our 1-1s - this will be based on the [PMFlyWheel](https://www.strongproductpeople.com/pmwheel).

In order to not suffer from recency bias when performance cycles come around, I consistently record significant conversations, achievements, feedback from others, and opportunies in a document for each of my team members. This will be the base for our convo at the end of a performance cycle. It will help me work with you on your growth, promotion or anything else you and I have agreed to work towards. I encourage you to do the same for yourself so you can share with me if I missed anything.

Please remember; I'm here to help you and lead you to the role/goals you have, let's work together, openly to get you there. My goal is to make my feedback always fair, and empathic. I like to use the [SBI](https://fellow.app/blog/feedback/sbi-feedback-model/) framework to provide and support my evaluation of your performance.

In addition, please also understand and remember that I'm hired by the business to successfully run the product function by hiring, building and fostering the right people for the job. I understand that if you or I know you are not ready for the job anymore, we will talk and discuss the next steps that are best for the business and yourself. 

## 3. Product

Over my 10+ years in product management, I concluded that I prefer working in the SaaS / B2B product space. To me, it's the best value exchange you can ask for between a company and customers; People seek solutions that will help them get a task done better and/or more cheaply, and with companies looking for compound strategies, customers know now that they can look and ask for products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform. They will want to pay for this while providing valuable and continuous feedback.

### Strategy - my version
Below is a screenshot of a slide I like to use to align teams on how to think and work through strategy. The word strategy can be so dry, theoretical and a catchword for so many unclear directions. I've built on top of a definition I once read and used a little framework to break it down into actionable pieces.

![](https://github.com/bbinto/working-with-bb/blob/main/img/strategy-breakdown.png)

### Execution and Strategy
While I know and believe a good strategy is pertinent path to keep everyone focused, motivated and in one common direction, what I have learned is that people love to advice on how/what to do to solve a problem but not all can and want to actually DO what they say. In case you want a former US president to further elaborate on this, have a quick look at this [video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/barbarabermes_when-former-us-president-barack-obama-was-activity-7079049160699613186-hFOQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) from Obama.
 
**"Just learn how to get stuff done."** 

I highly recommend and refer a lot to Frank Slootman's ["Amp it up"](https://www.amazon.ca/Amp-Unlocking-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Intensity/dp/1119836115) book that outlines similar concepts above.
Strategy is highly correlated and measured by quarterly and yearly OKRs for me. I like to use outcome-driven roadmaps that level up to OKRS and the vision of the company, see [this](https://bbinto.medium.com/why-is-this-still-so-hard-data-literacy-in-modern-product-design-teams-36501cedab84) post for more details and templates.

### Documents, Frameworks and Planning

Let's be honest, every company wants/can/ will do specific artifacts differently. There is no right way, nor one size fits all, therefore, here are some templates/guidelines that helped me before. 

It's immensely vital to understand the phases of a project within *your* company. Having the right stakeholders with the right and enough amount of information in every stage is crucial in keeping the project moving in the right direction with the least amount of delays or duplication of interruptions. 

Some high-level topics and ideas are below (not a full list and definitely the most debatable section of HOW to work)

**Kick-off**
* Project Alignment Document (PAD), template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qfP3-mXilJ_TmUf3B654DdrNfgnZh2P1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true), can be used for product reviews, concise to avoid going down too deep. Use the PAD to form a proper PRD and/or kick-off deck. 

**Development**
* Use Jira (or Linear) to track ALL work, use templates on how to write user stories, decide who owns breaking down the tickets, sizing them etc. The roles [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=2005876786) will help.
* I encourage weekly status updates, and/or Jira timelines/reports to detect productivity and issues. Having a good amount of bugs taken/rejected status is useful too.
* Bug bashes, continuous QA is a must, make sure the roles are clearly defined as well.

**Go-To-Market & Post GTM**

* Go-to-market (GTM) and GTM process: It's always good to define different tiers of features and releases to help communicate impact/training/sales on the specific feature. I make sure my team works closely with your CX and marketing leader. The name of the game here is consistency and timely accuracy. Knowing how and when to communicate internally first is key for a successful customer-facing launch. 
* Ongoing: Align your persona and segments with your x-teams, especially marketing. I have seen this before, product, marketing and sales all speak of different personas or segments and how they are defined. This is crucial for speaking the same language and therefore addressing the problems/solution for the right/correct segment.
* Feature review: This is extremely paramount to me and isn't been done often, make sure to review the launched product/feature and iterate/learn from it. Use this meeting/deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11FtrCSee-qabQoSqItSitpl-pagK37on/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true) as a start.

**On-going/Quarterly**

The following artifacts, frameworks and operations all are preferred by me when running product teams throughout the quarter.
(Please note some of the below documents can't be shared in template form due to business insights and data)

* OKRs, quarterly/rolled up to company OKRs, reviewed monthly, trackable daily (via dashboards). Aligned with the OKRs, teams work best when they have proper OKR dashboards available to them and their leaders. I will ask you/the data team to provide them for each quarter, they will be input for our monthly chats.
* Outcome driven roadmap, see my post [here](https://bbinto.medium.com/the-behavioural-and-relational-characteristics-of-successful-product-teams-94c4255bdb8) for some Miro inspiration and template.
* Structured operating model aligned to quarterly planning, inspired by ["The Cadence"](https://medium.com/craft-ventures/the-cadence-how-to-operate-a-saas-startup-436aa8099e8).
* Ideas & Prioritization Exercises; it's crucial to align with everyone on your team, including myself and upper management how input is being treated. There are many inputs we can use to build our quarter, roadmap, strategy and next few years for your team, e.g. general inputs: current OKRs, company strategy, NPS, CSAT, CX tickets, feature requests, current feature adoption dashboards, monthly product performance [read-outs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b4ITyBz35ij_iDnlUQBBdqCw1AkMWMeU/view?usp=sharing). Below are some examples to help you collect and prioritize
    * [$40 Prio exercise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=1559938549)
    * OKR draft/working [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPSsxhsUJUbiAdJfezXtOydVFYxwvqXiA_XriGvcaI/edit#gid=709501430), ideally with included RICE for everyone to see why/what/why not
    * Don't forget about bugs, tech debt etc; please make sure to allocate time, and if needed, use the sheet to prioritize ruthlessly [RICE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_PnuXIKeUv2FDk2l-GaBv07d9bmG6FV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106870703922353692262&rtpof=true&sd=true) for bugs
    * Throughout the quarter/year, I ask you to be proactive and show motivation for your product area, I invite you to constantly ask yourself; what needs to be changed, and can be done better? How can we do things better?

## Closing

As the document is titled, it's my operating system. Like any good software or OS, it will need updates, fixes and [upgrades](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0992944562/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) etc. Therefore, this is an ambitious, ever-evolving version of a document on how I like to work as a leader, empowering teams to build the best products while being the most motivated possible with the most empathic and honest relationships amongst their peers.

If you have read until now, I assume you are interested in working with me, collaborating or giving me feedback on the above. I'm excited for any comment.
