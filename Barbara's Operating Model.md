# Barbara's Operating System (BOS)

The following list and notes aim to share with the reader how/why/when I operate as a product leader. It's like my own Operating System. It helps you understand what I consider good work, being efficient, providing safety and continous and honest feedback.

**Foundation: Psychological Safety (PS)***: 
Basis for all my actions, drivers and asks is "Psychological Safety". Many have defined and explained it, most notable as one of the key outcomes during the Aristotle (https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/) research done by Google, yet the best definition I have heard is PS is the feeling is safe to feel uncomfortable. 

On top of above foundation, I like to breakdown my leadership into the following 3 pillars that are distributed based on the business needs:

1. **Process**: Process is important, pending the size and growth stage the company is in, process and operations needs to be tigher than for e.g. smaller companies
2. **People**: How I define people management, value indivualism, thrive for inclusion and diversity and psychological saftey
3. **Product**: My product management principles, the way I think, manage and learned what is important about good product manegement, including elaborating on my strengths and weakenesses

### 1. Process (including Norms & Principles)
In order to build on top of psychological safety, team members must feel comfortable sharing any uncomfortable events and news without being punished not following the group norms. In order to identify these events, teams need to understand and align on expectations.
Expecations are the basis to form and follow norms and principles. If we are all clear on expectations, we know what to commit to, how to build trust, and how/when to escalate concerns. The team, collectively will come up with norms and principles that each commits to adhere to.

#### Timely (Over) Communication
There is never too much communication nor oversharing. Ideally provide a tl;dr and a thread/link to more context if needed.

As for timely, I rather have you bring up issues, concerns, information ealier than later and worst, not at all, therefore, please consider the following; when in doubt, please do communicate.

"Over"-communication is a word you will hear from me a lot. 

Specially for async comms via channels like Slack/Teams, I want you to follow the below considerations
- Remember, attention is a commodity, choose wisely if/when to tag a team or person
- Always be polite and assume positive intend; we all have cultural differences, ways of communicating AND receiving feedback. Research has shown that politness async, in writing is even more important than verbal politeness.

#### Share Impact
Especially for remote workforces, continous sharing of impact can't be ignored. I have seen this before, people assumed what they did is either not a big deal, or don't want to bother anybody with it, and therefore don't share their work or impact. Most of the time, this impact is of interest to somebody, writing it into a channel, present it at an all-hands or weekly meeting is crucial to not only keep the conversations going but also share what you have worked on. 

As part of your individual and team performance, I will ask you to share your most impactful projects within each performance cycle, the more data related to OKRs and impact, the better.

#### Context is King
Phrased as "lead with context and not control" by Reed Hastings in [No rules rules](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention), providing context to your team is key in building trust and motivating team members. This is especially important when you have not only ICs but also managers and several levels of managers below you.

#### Special Section: Executives
I've noticed over the years that it's difficult at times for more junior people and ICs to know what to share and what not to share with executives. Of course, that depends not only on the person but also the executive. 
The biggest rule of thumb is; you can share all the problems with them/me, but please be prepared to follow up with options/solutions immediately without being asked specifcially. That shows you are concious of the executives time and know how to make sure they leave the conversation hopeful and trustful in you.

Be super aware of how to not overload your exectuive with information. They [hear](https://blog.staysaasy.com/p/dont-bring-me-problems-bring-me-solutions?utm_source=pocket_reader), see, respond to many small and big fires, help them understand quickly what is at stakes: Apply the [billboard](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7162791135776632832/) test, what can you say in the fewest amount of words to get people to stay attentive?

#### Meetings
##### Welcome / First Time Meeting

The goal of our first 1-1 is to get to know you, give you space and time to ask questions and most importantly leave you energized and motivated to start working together.

Before our first official 1-1, feel free to review these questions[5](about:blank#fn5) as we will be going through them together in the next few 1-1s. I strongly believe by having your answers to these questions, I will be able to support you the best.

- What makes you unhappy?
- How will I know when you’re unhappy?
- How can I help you when you’re unhappy?
- In what medium (Slack, email, Zoom, etc.) do you prefer to receive feedback?
- When do you prefer to receive feedback—routinely in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?
- How do you prefer to receive recognition—publicly or privately?
- What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
- What are your career goals for next year? And for the next three months?
- What do you need from your manager?
- What do you need from your teammates?
- What do you need from your peers outside the team?
- What’s your favorite way to treat yourself?
- What is something that will surprise me about you?

##### User Manuals
In addition, I will ask you to write up your own personal user manual and share it with me/accessible to all within the company.

Here is mine: [[[LINK]]]

##### 1:1 Meetings
My goal is to almost never skip 1-1s, if I do, I normally explain and provide context and at least try to re-schedule. The 1-1 is for you, about you! Please use the prepared questions and or notes to list out any topics you want to discuss. 

I tend to schedule a personal OKR meeting each month to discuss career goals, so we both keep chatting about growth, and opportunities and don't get distracted by daily topics.

#### Team Meetings
Equally important and similar to 1-1 meetings are team meetings. They can be scheduled weekly, bi-weekly or monthly pending on the size of my direct reports, the growth of the company and the maturity. The goal of these meetings is to form and build a high performanent team that can trust and support each other. This includes getting to know each other beyond work, team building activities and alignment on how to be successful. 

#### "No device" Meetings
In general, I trust and believe people have good attention to stay connected to the topic of the meeting they are in. I also know though that things can distract us = slack and phones. I will ask you, at times, for specific meetings to not look at your other devices. It's for the broader good and it's respectful to give your co-workers or manager the attention and focus they deserve. Don't argue with me on that, if you are/get distracted, drop or don't join the meeting. 

## 2. People

#### What I will give you
As your manager, I want you to know that I will always try my best to provide you with psychological safety[1](about:blank#fn1), transparency, constructive and honest feedback, context and trust. One of my most important goals as a manager is to help you excel in your career, highlight your best skills, and will always look for opportunities where I can help support you to grow. 

I want to help and do anything I can to make sure you feel comfortable and supported by me throughout our journey together, so you can perform at your best and be your most authentic self. And please remember, your (mental/physical) health always goes first! I’ll try my best to not disturb you via email/Slack message outside of working hours, if I ever do so though, I do not expect you to reply right away.

I consider my management and leadership style as a “[Connector](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/insights/publications/connector-manager)”.

Like anybody else, well, any normal human being, I have days, times and moments where I make mistakes and I will try my best to share and be transparent about it. It’s equally ok **and** important that you feel comfortable making mistakes as well, so that we can learn and improve from them.

Emotional Intelligence AND vulernability belong under the great leadership definition; With that comes times where I will share and feel I don't have all the answers and will admit; because if you wonder, I do also know and feel the [Imposter Syndrome](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pSfKUC2fhCmEzQ_mX9kdyHUmZi6xoQuh/view?usp=sharing) from time to time.

#### What I will ask of you
What I would like to ask from you is that you (aspire to) show up with these 3 important traits (and I’ll do the same): **self-awareness**[2](about:blank#fn2)**, reliability**[3](about:blank#fn3)**, and accountability**[4](about:blank#fn4).

#### Relationship with Engineering & Design (, and others)
Culture is defined as what happens when you are not in the room. The most important and unfortunately sometimes not recgonized and valued enough is your relationship with engineering. Design and product, in my experience work easier together. 

I ask you to please get to know, build, foster your relationship with your engineering and design counter part. This goes beyond "I told her about x", "we talked about y" - Building trust and the correct culture needs time and requires to truly get to know your team. Take the time, setup 1-1s, share feedback early.

#### Performance

I prefer to use leveling documents, and try to assess your skills in the first 1-2 months working together, this will all be transparently shared and discussed with you. I will share the spreadsheet with you in one of our 1-1s.

I have a notepad I use to jot down opportunities, wins, impact etc, screenshots, emails etc. during each performance cycle. I encourage you to do the same for yourselve so you can share with me if I missed anything.

I'm here to help you, and lead you to the role/goals you have, let's work together, openly to get you there.
My goal is to make my feedback always be fair, and empathic. I like to use the [SBI](https://fellow.app/blog/feedback/sbi-feedback-model/) framework to provide and support my evaluation of your performance.

#### Execution and Strategy
While I know and believe a good strategy is a great path to keep everyone focused and in one common direction, what I have learned is that it's equally important it's not what you SAY, but it's what you DO, execution is at times more important. Have a quick look at this [video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/barbarabermes_when-former-us-president-barack-obama-was-activity-7079049160699613186-hFOQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) from Obama.
 
"Just learn how to get stuff done." 

I also highly recommend and refer a lot to Frank's "Amp it up" book that outlines similar concepts than above.

Strategy is highly correalted and measured by quarterly and yearly OKRs for me. I like to use outcome-driven roadmaps that level up to OKRS and vision of the company, see [this](https://bbinto.medium.com/why-is-this-still-so-hard-data-literacy-in-modern-product-design-teams-36501cedab84) post for more details and templates.
